Barcode Scanning in Manufacturing
=================================

This module allows you to use a barcode scanner to avoid clicking in the tablet interface of the MRP module.

============

This module depends on the enterprise module "quality_mrp".

* Fail (quality check)

Barcodes were generated thanks to `https://barcode.tec-it.com/en/Code128 <https://barcode.tec-it.com/en/Code128>`_.
