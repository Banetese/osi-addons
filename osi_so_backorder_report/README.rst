========
Overview
========

This module adds the ability to view UIGD and Backordered products on
Sales Oders.
The quantity and the value of both UIGD and Backordered products is computed
for sales order lines and then aggregated for display on the parent
sales order.

Usage
=====
Install the module. In the sales module, under the Sales menu, select the 
SO Lines and Backorders menu option.
This will display a tree view of all sale order lines with their UIGD and
Backorder information as well as the last date delivered and the last date
billed. Use the Backorders report menu to print a report.
